## Description

This web application is a trivia quiz game that uses server side API to generate questions and choices to the user. The application also uses giphy server side API to generate hints and store high scores on the local storage.

## Usage

To use the application, click on "Let's start" button and choose a category and difficulty level before clicking "Play!" button. Once the game begins, you will be presented with a question and four choices. If you think you know the answer simply click on one of the choices, the question will have a red background if it is incorrect, or green background if it is correct, before going to the next question.

You can also use hints and 50 / 50 buttons during you game once. So use them wisely. Hint gives you a hint based on the correct answer in the form of a GIF. and 50 / 50 button removes two incorrect choices.

You will also notice "Lives" and "Score" below the quiz. You will get three lives per game, and you will lose one life per each incorrectly answered question. The score represents the number of quetions passed - this includes wrongly answered questions. The goal of the game is to reach a score of 10, without losing any lives.

At the end of the game you will be prompted to input your initials and click "Submit" button, after which your score, difficulty mode and initials will be saved locally. You can access it by clicking on "Highscores" in the navigation menu. There is also an option to reset the highscores, by pressing "Reset Highscores" button within the modal.
